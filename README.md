## What is Bootstrap

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a free, open-source, mobile-first, and popular CSS framework that allows you to build responsive websites and web applications. Bootstrap can be used with almost any Single Page Application (SPA) library such as React, Vue, Angular, and others. We wrote a guide on how you could set up Bootstrap with React, [check it out](https://www.copycat.dev/blog/reactjs-bootstrap/).

## What is Bootstrap Card

Bootstrap card is a responsive and customizable mobile-friendly content container. It is essentially an element that wraps children's elements providing tons of options for custom card images, headers, footers, contextual background colors, and a lot of other options such as background colors.

Cards can be used to group related content such as on a page to display related content about an article, an image thumbnail, an article title, article preview text, and an article link.
